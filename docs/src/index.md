# RandomPhaseApproximation

Documentation for [RandomPhaseApproximation](https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/RandomPhaseApproximation.jl).

## Introduction

Standard random phase approximation (particle-hole channel) for quantum lattice systems based on the [QuantumLattices](https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/QuantumLattices.jl) and [TightBindingApproximation](https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/TightBindingApproximation.jl) packages.

## Installation

In Julia **v1.8+**, please type `]` in the REPL to use the package mode, then type this command:

```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/RandomPhaseApproximation.jl
```
